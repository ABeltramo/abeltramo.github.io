title: "When uinput Isn't Enough: Virtualizing a DualSense controller"
description: "Why `uinput` doesn't work for motion sensors support on a virtual joypad"
---

I've been working on an open source project called https://github.com/games-on-whales/inputtino[inputtino]: a library that allows you to create and use virtual input devices (ex: mouse, keyboard, joypads) on Linux.

Most of the devices are built using the https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/uinput.html[uinput kernel module]
and controlled via https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libevdev/[libevdev].
With that, it was fairly easy to create virtual joypads that would be correctly recognised like an Xbox or Nintendo controller.
Given those two were working fine, I've decided to try and replicate a PS controller too.

== Just use uinput, right?

The PS4 and PS5 controllers also include a Gyroscope, Accelerometer and a Touchpad.
The open source driver https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/305230142ae0637213bf6e04f6d9f10bbcb74af8/drivers/hid/hid-playstation.c[hid-playstation] exposes all these features as 3 separate input devices:

----
/dev/input/event20:	Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller
/dev/input/event21:	Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller Motion Sensors
/dev/input/event22:	Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller Touchpad
----

Ideally, we should be able to use `uinput` to create these devices independently; and that's exactly the path that I've followed at the start of this journey. +

I've managed to replicate the DualSense controller with 3 separate devices, I could see them in `evtest`
and `evemu-record` and they were reporting the right values when trying to emulate gyro and acceleration. +
So why would no game pick up the motion sensor data?

On top of that, The DualSense controller also includes: LED, microphone, speaker, haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
All stuff that *isn't exposed as input devices*, so where would that extra stuff be coming from?
And how can I replicate it?

We have to dive deeper..

== How SDL2 links these 3 devices into a single joypad?

The best way to understand how things might work inside a game is to look at how SDL2 handles this.
Even if a game might not use SDL as a library, it's very likely that the logic would be similar.

The rabbit hole starts in https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/9225a421b790cf24aaef307e088c3d260a81e5a1/src/joystick/SDL_joystick.c#L722-L723[SDL_GetJoysticks()]
where SDL starts to look for joysticks in your system (newer https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/9225a421b790cf24aaef307e088c3d260a81e5a1/src/joystick/SDL_gamepad.c#L2408-L2409[SDL_GetGamepads()] is just a wrapper around this method).

[source,c]
....
SDL_JoystickID *SDL_GetJoysticks(int *count)
{
    // ...

        for (i = 0; i < SDL_arraysize(SDL_joystick_drivers); ++i) {
            total_joysticks += SDL_joystick_drivers[i]->GetCount();
        }

    // ...

        for (device_index = 0; device_index < num_joysticks; ++device_index) {
            SDL_assert(joystick_index < total_joysticks);
            joysticks[joystick_index] = SDL_joystick_drivers[i]->GetDeviceInstanceID(device_index);
        }
}
....

Looks like SDL2 is iterating over a list of drivers and then calling `GetCount()` to see how many joysticks are available and finally accessing them via `GetDeviceInstanceID()`.

For brevity, I'll skip the details over the SDL drivers, but the main point is that the https://github.dev/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/SDL_joystick.c[sysjoystick] driver is the one that will be picking up our virtual `/dev/input/event*` devices.
This will internally use `udev`, `inotify`
and ultimately just a raw scan of `/dev/input` to find the joysticks and to listen for hotplug events.

So, the implementation of `GetCount()` is https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/9225a421b790cf24aaef307e088c3d260a81e5a1/src/joystick/linux/SDL_sysjoystick.c#L1075-L1080[just returning a variable], bummer.
Turns out the variable is set in `LINUX_JoystickInit()`, that's where the detection happens.

First off, SDL2 assumes that every `/dev/input/event*` device might be a joypad, so it opens them all to check if they are based on some heuristics.
The main meat for us is in https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/9225a421b790cf24aaef307e088c3d260a81e5a1/src/joystick/linux/SDL_sysjoystick.c#L434-L435[MaybeAddDevice()], which calls `bool IsJoystick()` and `bool IsSensor()`, bingo!

After debugging the code, I've found that our two virtual devices (joypad and motion sensor) are both being recognised as joypads, passing the `IsJoystick()` check! +
Turns out that the problem was in a completely different place:

[source,c]
....
/*
 * Return 1 if the gamepad should be ignored by SDL
 */
bool SDL_ShouldIgnoreGamepad(Uint16 vendor_id, Uint16 product_id, Uint16 version, const char *name)
{
#ifdef SDL_PLATFORM_LINUX
    if (SDL_endswith(name, " Motion Sensors")) {
        // Don't treat the PS3 and PS4 motion controls as a separate gamepad
        return true;
    }
    if (SDL_strncmp(name, "Nintendo ", 9) == 0 && SDL_strstr(name, " IMU") != NULL) {
        // Don't treat the Nintendo IMU as a separate gamepad
        return true;
    }
    if (SDL_endswith(name, " Accelerometer") ||
        SDL_endswith(name, " IR") ||
        SDL_endswith(name, " Motion Plus") ||
        SDL_endswith(name, " Nunchuk")) {
        // Don't treat the Wii extension controls as a separate gamepad
        return true;
    }
#endif
....

Right, so everything is a gamepad unless it's ignored.. +
Changing the name to end with `" Motion Sensors"` got us around the first hurdle, SDL will now correctly pick up the virtual joypad as a controller and the virtual motion sensor as a sensor.

The main issue now seems to be in linking these 2 devices together as a single joypad.
The way SDL2 does this is to match the `uniq` identifier (using the ioctl `EVIOCGUNIQ` https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/4189edaeb7ce4da9ab420b98904fa22196fb3dca/src/joystick/linux/SDL_sysjoystick.c#L1508[in this method]) between what is recognised as sensor and what is recognised as joypad. +
Unfortunately, there's no way to set the `uniq` for an uinput device; there's https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20191201145357.ybq5gfty4ulnfasq@pali/t/#u[a proposal] to add this to the Linux kernel but as of March 2024 this has still not been merged.

So what happens in practice is that SDL ends up discarding that sensor and just using the joypad instead.

== So what now?

Having all the debugging setup in place turned out to be invaluable, what would SDL2 do when I plug a real DualSense controller?
Turns out that it wouldn't follow the same code path, instead, the `hidapi` driver would be used to access the controller directly via USB.

After some more digging, I found out about https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/hid/uhid.html[UHID]:

`UHID` allows us to completely replicate the DualSense controller at a lower level.
The device that we'll create via UHID will be picked up by the kernel https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/hid/hid-playstation.c[hid-playstation] just like a USB connected DualSense controller would be, which in turn will create the `/dev/input/event` devices and downstream applications will see the 3 devices as they should be.

In the link:{{< ref "inputtino-uhid-2" >}}[next post] I'll go over the details of how I've implemented the UHID device and how it's working out in *inputtino*.
