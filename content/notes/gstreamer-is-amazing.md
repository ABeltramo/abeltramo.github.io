**Gstreamer is amazing**, I can mix and match from hundreds of plugins to create a pipeline that can do anything I want!

**Gstreamer is great**, sure it's a bit complex at first, and I'm not sure what's going on under the hood, but I'm sure
the more I use it the more I'll get comfortable with it.

**Gstreamer is good**, everything being a plugin means that I can just build my own plugins and extend it to do whatever
I need.

**Gstreamer is ok**, you can build very complex stuff with it! I'm just waiting for the next release, there are a few
annoying bugs and a lot of features that I'm waiting to see implemented.

Why is this pipeline leaking memory?
Why is `appsrc`growing in size above and beyond the specified `max-bytes`[^1] (aka: “The
maximum number of bytes to queue internally”)? **WTF Gstreamer?**
